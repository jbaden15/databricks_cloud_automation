overview: Generic implementation of a VPC peering between Databricks and another ("foreign") VPC.

description: This includes the peering itself, configuring route tables, and updating security groups

use_cases: >
  Access an existing Database or AWS service in a VPC, including but not limited to:
  - Redshift
  - RDS
  - Kafka
  - Cassandra
  - EMR / Hive Metastore
  - Aurora

scope: >
  - This module is closely based off the existing documentation: https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/vpc-peering.html
  - This module can be used as an automated alternative to this documentation.
  - This module assumes that the "foreign" VPC already exists. It will not attempt to create the VPC if it is not found.
